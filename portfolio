          The motivation behind my undertaking of the sound redesign for the Industria 2 teaser stemmed from the fact that, although it is set within a science fiction universe, the environment carries a distinctly organic character—spaces where every minute detail of the player’s surroundings must be perceptible. Consequently, I chose to blend organic sounds enhanced by rich reverberations, while the more robotic sounds were crafted using digital audio synthesis techniques.          </p>

          I designed the complete sound kit in the original video with the intention of capturing the same essence as the original game—abilities that make the player feel truly powerful and justify the anticipation before delivering damage to the enemy. The sounds were crafted through post-processing techniques based on a library of foley recordings.          </p>

          Upon first encountering this weapon in-game, its impact was deeply imprinted in my mind. The sheer sense of power and the urge to push forward that it conveys to the player is remarkable. I chose to replicate it alongside environmental reverb to further enhance the sonic potential the weapon represents. Both the charging and firing sounds were created through digital post-processing, starting from white noise as the foundational sound source.          </p>
